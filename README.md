# üßÆ Optimization Model Project - Linear Programming with PuLP

This project demonstrates how to solve a real-world business optimization problem using *Linear Programming (LP)* with the PuLP library in Python.

---

## üéØ Objective

To determine the optimal number of two products to manufacture in order to *maximize total profit*, subject to resource constraints such as machine time and labor.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

A company produces two products: *Product A* and *Product B*.

- Each unit of *Product A* requires:
  - 2 hours of machine time
  - 1 hour of labor
- Each unit of *Product B* requires:
  - 1 hour of machine time
  - 1 hour of labor

Available Resources:
- Maximum *100 machine hours*
- Maximum *80 labor hours*

Profit:
- ‚Çπ20 per unit of Product A  
- ‚Çπ60 per unit of Product B

üîé *Goal*: Maximize profit without exceeding available resources.
